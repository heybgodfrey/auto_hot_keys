Custom Ink Creative Services will bring your dream design to life! Whether you have a photograph, a sketch, or just an idea, our team of professional artists will create a custom design for your custom-printed products. A quick note before we proceed: any designs created by Custom Ink will not be distributed, but they will appear on the product you order.

If that works for you, I need some information to get started.

•	Your deadline - we recommend having at least 2 weeks to work with
•	Your shipping zip code and budget (if any)
•	Desired product and color, as well as quantity. Please indicate smallest and largest sizes for apparel
•	Tell us your idea! Describe in detail what you'd like your design to look like: imagery you have in mind, colors you'd like included (or not), text you'd like to accompany the design and what style (if any), where do you
•	Send us design inspiration images or examples of what you'd like if you have them!
•	Your phone number in case we need to reach you for any additional details

The more information you can provide, the better, so we can create something that is exclusively designed for you!

Once the design is ready, you’ll receive an email from the artist including a link to the finalized custom design, thoughtfully placed on the product you want to order.

*Should you require further adjustments, please note you are limited to two rounds of changes.*

Custom Ink offers two different methods of printing, and we help determine what will best suit your artwork. We offer traditional screenprinting for the majority of our products, as well as digital printing on select items. Screenprinting involves creating a stencil (printers call this a "screen"), and then using that stencil to apply layers of different color inks. Digital printing works like a bigger, stronger version of the inkjet printer you may have at home for printing on paper. The inks blend together to create a wide spectrum of colors directly on the surface of your product. Digital printing is not a heat transfer or applique, as the ink is directly applied to the fabric of your shirt. Both screenprinting and digital printing are durable, with screenprinting offering a more vivid look that may last longer.

Custom Ink's volume discount kicks in if you order more shirts than your estimate, which lowers your per-item cost. However, your group members always pay the prices listed at the start of your Group Order Form. If you exceed your goal, you as the organizer receive a check for the remainder after the order is delivered. If you come in lower than your goal, you as the organizer are responsible for the difference in the balance. I always recommend underestimating how many shirts will be ordered just to be safe!

So many of our customers were doing amazing work for fundraisers and charities that we created Booster, a site devoted to helping group organizers use custom t-shirts as a fundraising tool. It's a unique way to fundraise, while building awareness of your cause within your community. You get to create an awesome design, set the price, and then use your personalized website to sell the shirts online. The difference between the print cost and price you've selected then goes to the non-profit or individual of your choice! For more information about Booster, please click on the link below:

http://customink.com/fundraising

If you'd like, I’m happy to take down your information and have a campaign advisor get in touch with you by phone or email to help you get started.

I definitely understand that sizing can be a hard one to determine when you are ordering online. We try to keep this as intuitive as possible. Did you get a chance to look at our sizing line up for these items?

[SIZING LINE UP]

How do you feel your shirts are fitting in comparison to this sizing chart?

Each person’s body is unique, which may cause items to fit differently. However, sometimes there are manufacturing errors where the item is mislabeled or incorrectly made. Because of these possibilities, we may have you send these items back for a print specialist to inspect.

If these items are incorrect, we will replace them. If they are what we state on our sizing line up, we can work out some special pricing on a new order for items that are needed. Does that work for you?

Hello there,

Thanks so much for reaching out to us about the problems you discovered with your order. I am so sorry to hear that the final product was inconsistent with the quality you were expecting. I want to be sure you're totally satisfied, and I can definitely work with you to get this resolved.

Is it possible for you to send me some photos of the problem spots? They can be a big help in documenting the mistakes up front and give us insight into the cause of the problem. It's possible we may need to have you return your items to fully understand the issue and ensure we provide you with the best resolution possible.

I want to make sure I'm working within your timeline; is there an upcoming event you need these for?  If it turns out that we don't have time for a full investigation, I'm happy to discuss other options with you.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about all of this, and I again apologize for the problem with your order.

Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you,

What you are describing sounds like an issue we occasionally run into that happens when there is a unique combination of temperature and humidity during the shipping process. If I am correct, the great news is that a quick run through the wash will completely remedy this situation. Please take a picture showing the shirts and reply back to this email so I can be sure. Then, I’ll likely have you toss at least one in the wash to see if that fixes things. If not, I can work on getting the shirts back for our team to inspect

The way our group order form works is really awesome! After you create and Save Your Design, you put in an estimate for how many shirts you think your group might need then you are provided with pricing based off of your design/estimated quantity.

You will then be offered a personalized link to send out your group to send out to your group that they can use to order and even pay for their shirts. Once the form is closed and all the payments are collected the order is ready to be placed. As soon as its place and we will deliver it to you, the organizer, within 2 weeks. Does that sound like it might work for you?

We can absolutely work with your photograph and transform it into a design on one of our products. The final printed design may depend on the quality of your image, the type of product you're interested in, and the style of design you're looking for. To guarantee your image will look great when we print it, we require a minimum resolution determined by the size of the printed design.

Currently, your image is not at a high enough resolution to print at your desired size. Do you happen to have a higher-resolution image we can use instead? If not, we can create something for you in our Design Lab using our awesome artwork!

To guarantee your image will look great when we print it, we require a minimum resolution determined by the size of the printed design. 

Your image is not at a high enough resolution to print at your current size. Do you happen to have a higher-resolution image we can use instead? If not, we can create something for you in our Design Lab using our huge selection of artwork!

Custom Ink Fundraising is a site devoted to helping group organizers use custom t-shirts as a fundraising tool. It's a unique way to not only fundraise, but build awareness of your cause within your community. You get to create an awesome design, set the price, and then use your personalized website to sell the shirts online. The difference between the production cost and price you've selected then goes to the non-profit or individual of your choice!

Looking through your design, I noticed it contains protected imagery. What this means is that in order to print PROTECTEDIMAGERYDESCRIPTION, we need permission from the person or company that owns the rights to the image. Are you able to get the permission to print? If not, we can work together using our clipart to adjust your design so we can move forward with your order.

The pricing of extended sizes (2XL-6XL) varies based on the product. You can expect anywhere from $2.50-$7 per item. Do you have an idea of the quantity and sizes you'll need? I can update the quote based on those specifics.

It looks like payment did not go through on your order. We accept payment from all major credit cards, via check, or purchase order (schools). Simply give us a call at 1-866-779-3570, and we can assist you with completing payment on your order. We ask that you not send us any payment information in an email as it is not secure.

Keep in mind, we cannot start processing your order until payment is completed, so the sooner payment is completed, the sooner we can start working on bringing your order to life!
